Create a new BankCustomer structure type, which keeps track of customer ID, type of account
(‘c’ for checking, ‘s’ for savings, ‘d’ for deposit), and account balance.  
Declare an array of 10 such customers, and read in their data from this file.  At the end, write out:

The average balance for all checking accounts,
The average balance for all savings accounts, and
The average balance for all deposit accounts.
